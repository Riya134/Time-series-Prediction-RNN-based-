The project is based on the time series prediction and forecast of a retail sales data for clothing and accessory stores. </br>
The dataset has been obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, Fred and it looks like </br> </br>

</br>
The project includes steps like - 
</br> </br> 
     -Analyzing the data</br>
     -Preprocessing the dataset</br>
     -Splitting the dataset </br>
     -Creating an RNN based Model </br>
     -Making Predictions </br>
     -And lastly making Forecasts </br>
